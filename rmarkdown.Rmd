When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

## Including Maths Formulas

To put a maths formula in a sentence, we put the formula inside dollar signs

The quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$

To put a Maths formula as a centered equation, we put it inside double dollar signs

then it will come out as an equation which is centered $$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$

To include fractions, we use the Frac command

$$y=\frac{x^2+1}{3}$$

To include Greek letters, you just type backslash before the Greek letter

$$\beta$$
$$\alpha$$
